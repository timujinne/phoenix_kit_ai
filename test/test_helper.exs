# Test helper for PhoenixKitAI test suite
#
# Level 1: Unit tests (schemas, changesets, pure functions) always run.
# Level 2: Integration tests need a real PostgreSQL database — most of the
#          suite (~550 of ~910 tests), since `PhoenixKitAI.DataCase` and
#          `PhoenixKitAI.LiveCase` both tag every test they template
#          `:integration`.
#
# `mix test` provisions its own database automatically: the `test:` alias
# in mix.exs runs `ecto.create --quiet` first, same contract as any
# standard Phoenix app. If the database is still unusable after that —
# unreachable host, wrong credentials, migrations that fail — THIS FILE
# MUST ABORT THE RUN with a nonzero exit. It must NOT print a warning and
# quietly exclude the `:integration` tag: that turns "the database is
# broken" into "358 tests, 0 failures" and nobody notices for months (see
# the incident this rewrite fixes — the old fail-soft below caught every
# exception/exit from a dead connection pool, downgraded it to a `false`
# flag, and dropped 551 tests while reporting success).
#
# The ONLY sanctioned way to run without a database is the explicit,
# off-by-default opt-in below:
#
#   PK_AI_SKIP_DB=1 mix test
#
# for a contributor machine that genuinely has no Postgres and only wants
# the ~360 pure-unit tests. CI and the standard local/precommit workflow
# must never set this — a database failure there means something is
# actually broken and the run should go red.

# Elixir 1.19's `mix test` no longer auto-loads modules from
# `:elixirc_paths` test directories at test-helper time — only files
# matching `:test_load_filters` get loaded by the test runner. Support
# modules are compiled but not loaded, so explicit `Code.require_file/2`
# calls are needed before `test_helper.exs` references them.
support_dir = Path.expand("support", __DIR__)

# Only `require_file` when the module isn't already compiled-and-loaded
# — otherwise ExUnit's own auto-load emits a "redefining module"
# warning.
