defmodule PhoenixKitAI.Translation do
  @moduledoc """
  Generic AI translation helper. Translates a `%{field_name => text}`
  map from `source_lang` to `target_lang` using PhoenixKitAI's endpoint
  and prompt system, and parses the structured response back into the
  same shape.

  Designed to be the single orchestration layer shared by every
  feature module that wants AI translation — `phoenix_kit_publishing`,
  `phoenix_kit_projects`, future consumers. Each module wraps this
  helper in its own Oban worker (or controller action) and owns the
  per-module storage write, broadcasts, caching, and per-resource
  activity log entry.

  ## What lives here

  - Prompt rendering with `{{SourceLanguage}}` / `{{TargetLanguage}}`
    / arbitrary field-name variables, plus the computed `{{SourceFields}}`
    block (one `---MARKER---` section per field actually passed — see
    `build_variables/3`). A prompt template can use either mechanism:
    the old per-field slots keep working unchanged, `{{SourceFields}}`
    is additive.
  - The `PhoenixKitAI.ask_with_prompt/4` call, wrapped so provider
    errors and unexpected response shapes normalize to tagged errors.
  - A structured-response parser for the `---FIELD_NAME---` shape
    that publishing's prompt template ships with. Generalised — any
    list of field names is accepted, ordering follows the input.
  - Error normalisation: every failure path returns
    `{:error, atom_or_tuple}` so callers can pattern-match without
    knowing whether the failure came from the plugin, the parser, or
    a network blip.
  - A single core activity-log entry (`core.ai_translation.requested`)
    on every dispatched request — gives Max a unified audit trail of
    AI token spend regardless of which feature module triggered it.
    Modules still log their own per-resource action (e.g.
    `publishing.translation.added`, `projects.translation.added`).

  ## What does NOT live here

  - Storage of the translation result — each consumer owns its own
    write path (publishing's `publishing_content` rows, projects'
    `Project.translations` JSONB, etc.).
  - Broadcasts — each consumer has its own PubSub topic shape.
  - Per-language status (in-flight, completed, errored) — that's the
    consumer's worker and the host UI.
  - Retry policy / queue choice — each consumer's Oban worker picks
    its own queue, max-attempts, and uniqueness constraints. This
    module is a synchronous function-call shape; consumers wrap it.

  ## Usage

  Translate `fields` from `source_lang` to `target_lang`.

  - `endpoint_uuid` — UUID of a configured `PhoenixKitAI` endpoint.
    Required even when the plugin is installed; the plugin's prompt
    machinery binds to a specific endpoint at call time.
  - `prompt_uuid` — UUID of a `PhoenixKitAI.Prompt` whose template
    references `{{SourceLanguage}}`, `{{TargetLanguage}}`, and one
    `{{<FieldName>}}` placeholder per key in `fields`.
  - `source_lang` / `target_lang` — language codes (base or dialect;
    the helper passes them through unchanged).
  - `fields` — `%{field_name => text}` map. Field names become the
    structured-response markers (`---<FIELD_NAME>---`, uppercased).

  ## Options

  - `:actor_uuid` — included in the `core.ai_translation.requested`
    activity log entry. When omitted the log is still written with
    `actor_uuid: nil`.
  - `:resource_type` / `:resource_uuid` — let the audit log point at
    the row being translated.
  - `:source` — string identifier for the calling module (e.g.
    `"Publishing.TranslatePostWorker"`); included in the
    `PhoenixKitAI` request log so usage reports break down by caller.

  Parses a structured `---FIELD_NAME---` response into a field map.

  Public for testing — consumers normally hit `translate_fields/6`,
  which calls this internally. Useful when a caller already has the
  raw AI response (e.g. a previously cached completion) and just
  needs to extract field values.

  Field names are matched case-insensitively against the markers but
  the returned map preserves the input casing of `fields` so callers
  can round-trip with their original field-name strings.

  **All requested fields must be present** in the response. When the
  model returns a partial response (e.g. it forgot the `---SLUG---`
  marker), this function returns
  `{:error, {:parse_error, {:missing_fields, [...]}}}` so the caller
  can decide whether to retry, fall back to the source value, or
  surface an error to the user — rather than silently persisting a
  half-translated row.
